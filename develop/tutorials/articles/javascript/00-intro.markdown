#intro

Liferay 7.0 brings with it quite a few updates to the front-end development 
tools. You can organize and share your code in a more logical way using 
the new JavaScript standard module syntax thanks to our config generator and AMD 
loader. You'll also be able to use any of your third party Libraries that are 
AMD compliant.

The JavaScript tutorials use code from the frontend-js-numsequences-web module, 
Sequences Explorer Portlet, and Sequences Chart Portlet. Using these modules and
portlets as an example, you'll learn how to implement the new es2015 features in 
your applications and JavaScript.
