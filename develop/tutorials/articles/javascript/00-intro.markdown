# Introduction [](id=intro)

Liferay 7.0 brings with it quite a few updates to the front-end development 
tools. You can now organize and share your code in a more logical way using 
the new JavaScript standard module syntax thanks to our [Config generator](https://github.com/ipeychev/lfr-module-config-generator) 
and [AMD Loader](https://github.com/ipeychev/lfr-amd-loader). You'll also be 
able to use any of your third party Libraries that are AMD compliant.

The JavaScript tutorials use code from the [frontend-js-numsequences-web module]( https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/develop/tutorials/code/liferay-plugins-sdk-7.0.0/portlets/frontend-js-numsequences-web), 
[Sequences Explorer Portlet]( https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/develop/tutorials/code/liferay-plugins-sdk-7.0.0/apps/sequences-explorer-web)
, and [Sequences Chart Portlet]( https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/develop/tutorials/code/liferay-plugins-sdk-7.0.0/apps/sequences-chart-web). 
Using these modules and portlets as an example, you'll learn how to implement 
the new [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html) 
features in your applications and JavaScript.
