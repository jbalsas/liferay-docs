# Using Liferay Frontend Taglibs in Your Portlet [](id=using-liferay-frontend-taglibs-in-your-portlet)

The Liferay Frontend tag library provides a set of tags for creating common 
frontend UI components in your app.  

To use the Frontend taglib, add the following declaration to your JSP:

    <%@ taglib prefix="liferay-frontend" uri="http://liferay.com/tld/frontend" %>

The following Frontend UI components are covered in this section of tutorials:

- [Add Menu](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-frontend-add-menu)
- [Cards](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-frontend-cards)
- [Info Bar](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-frontend-info-bar)
- [Management Bar](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-frontend-management-bar)

The tutorials in this section cover how to create these components with the 
Frontend taglibs. Each tutorial contains a set of examples along with a 
screenshot of the resulting UI.
